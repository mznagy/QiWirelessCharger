Wireless power reciever components:
- general purpose at microController
- pulp connected to a coil
- A coil for transmitting power (transmitter coil)
- A coil for receiving power (receiver coil)
- A power management IC
- A MOSFET for switching.


*We need to make sure that the Tx knows that the object above it is another coil (Rx) not a metal to avoid heating-up (due to eddy current) and corrupted*


Then:
Design the Transmitter Circuit:
The transmitter circuit consists of the transmitter coil, a driver circuit (to drive the coil), and a power supply. The driver circuit is usually controlled by a microcontroller, which modulates the power to the coil based on communication with the receiver.

Then:
Design the Receiver Circuit: 
The receiver circuit consists of the receiver coil, a rectifier (to convert AC to DC), a voltage regulator (to regulate the voltage), and a controller to manage charging.

Creating a Qi power receiver from scratch to light up a bulb using an ATmega32 microcontroller involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

Design the Receiver Circuit:

Start by designing the receiver circuit, which will include the receiver coil, rectifier, voltage regulator, and ATmega32 microcontroller.
The receiver coil will pick up the electromagnetic energy transmitted by the Qi transmitter.
The rectifier circuit will convert the alternating current induced in the coil to direct current.
The voltage regulator will stabilize the output voltage to power the microcontroller and other components.
Microcontroller Interface:

Connect the output of the voltage regulator to the power input of the ATmega32 microcontroller.
Implement communication interfaces such as SPI or I2C to communicate with external components or sensors if needed.
Control Logic:

Develop the control logic in the microcontroller to monitor the charging status and control the power output to the bulb.
Implement algorithms to detect the presence of the Qi transmitter, negotiate power transfer parameters, and manage charging.
Power Output to Bulb:

Connect the output pins of the microcontroller to a power switching circuit that can control the power supplied to the bulb.
Depending on the power requirements of the bulb, you may need to use a relay, MOSFET, or other suitable power switching device.
Testing and Debugging:

Test each component of the receiver circuit individually to ensure they function as expected.
Debug the microcontroller code to ensure it correctly interprets Qi communication and controls the power output to the bulb.
Integrate Qi Communication Protocol:

Implement the Qi communication protocol to enable communication with the Qi transmitter.
This involves establishing a connection, negotiating power transfer parameters, and monitoring charging status.
Lighting Up the Bulb:

Once the receiver circuit is working correctly and can communicate with the Qi transmitter, test the system by placing the receiver within range of the transmitter.
Verify that the bulb lights up when the charging process is initiated.
Optimization and Refinement:

Optimize the design for efficiency, reliability, and performance.
Refine the control logic to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.
Safety Considerations:

Ensure that the system includes safety features such as overvoltage protection, overcurrent protection, and temperature monitoring to prevent damage to the components and ensure safe operation.
Final Integration and Packaging:

Integrate the Qi receiver circuit into a suitable enclosure or product design.
Package the system appropriately for deployment, considering factors such as heat dissipation, durability, and user accessibility.
By following these steps, you can create a Qi power receiver using an ATmega32 microcontroller to light up a bulb wirelessly. Make sure to refer to datasheets, application notes, and Qi specifications for detailed technical information and guidelines throughout the design process.





NOTE:
both Tx and Rx are based on series LC (Coil & Capacitor) residence


Another requirement is to increase or decrease the transmitter power on demand by the receiver. This can also be achieved by continuous feedback from the receiver to the transmitter.
